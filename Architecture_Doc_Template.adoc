== Introduction and Goals

***

This section is usually used to provide the context of your project. It is helpful to give a contextual diagram to illustrate how the system you are building fits in with the existing applications at a high level.
You can provide:

* high level overview of the requirements,
* list of stakeholders,
* ..etc.

=== Objectives

***
Describe clearly and concisely the objectives (business and technical) of the application you are building.

=== Scope
***
Describe as clearly as possible which features are in and out of scope. Preferably list them as bullets instead of large paragraphs that stakeholders may not read.

=== Constraints and Risks
***
The Constraints that you have in your project will shape your architecture decisions. Try to identify them as early as possible in your project.

=== Requirements Overview
***
Short description of the business requirements, business drivers.
Indicate the link or the location of the detailed requirements.


=== Architecture Characteristics

***
This section identifies the architecture characteristics, also known as non-function requirements.

They are foundational to the architecture and are needed to analyze and make decisions.

Identifying the critical non-functional requirement and building your architecture based on this list is crucial.

The following are some examples of architecture characteristics: Performance, availability, fault tolerance, scalability, interoperability, extensibility, testability, configurability, maintainabilityâ€¦etc.

=== High-Level Architecture
***
In this section, you present the solution overview. Usually, you introduce the components composing your architecture and use Component/Module diagrams.
You may also use sequence diagrams to show interactions between the different components. Another important aspect is to identify the integration points with the other systems.

=== Detailed Architecture
***
In this section, you provide all the details of your architecture using different diagrams. Use various diagrams to represent different views of your solution, such as:

* Deployment Diagrams
* Runtime Diagrams
* Collaboration and sequence diagrams

It is also essential in this section to indicate how the non-functional requirements (characteristics) are driving the architecture decisions you are proposing.
