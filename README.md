## Documentation as Code
Treating documentation as code can improve the quality and consistency of documentation, reduce documentation maintenance overhead, and make it easier for architects and developers to collaborate on documentation changes.

With the Documentation as Code approach, the documentation is written in plain text markup languages like Markdown or Asciidoc, which are easy to read and write. The documentation files are then stored along with the code in a version control system like Git.
